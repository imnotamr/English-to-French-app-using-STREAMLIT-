## Live Demo
A live version of this translator is hosted at [Streamlit Cloud](https://share.streamlit.io/imnotamr/English-to-French-app-using-STREAMLIT/main/app.py). Visit the link to try the translator directly in your browser.

## Getting Started
These instructions will help you set up and run the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python 3.7 or newer installed. Also, it's recommended to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/imnotamr/English-to-French-app-using-STREAMLIT.git
   cd English-to-French-app-using-STREAMLIT
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Configuration
- The app uses Google Translate API (`googletrans`) and Google Text-to-Speech (`gTTS`). Both require an active internet connection.
- Optional: You may configure the app settings through Streamlit's sidebar, including future language support.

## Usage
1. **Text Input**: Enter any English word or phrase you want to translate.
2. **Document Upload**: Upload a Word (.docx) or PDF document for translation.
3. **Listen to Audio**: Play the text-to-speech versions for both the original and translated text.

### Example Workflow
- Start the Streamlit server using `streamlit run app.py`.
- Enter the text "Hello, how are you?" in the input box.
- Click the "Translate" button to get the French translation "Bonjour, comment Ã§a va?".
- Click the audio buttons to hear the translation in both languages.

## Project Structure
- **app.py**: Main Streamlit app file containing the application logic.
- **requirements.txt**: File containing all Python dependencies.
- **README.md**: Detailed information about the project.
- **.gitignore**: Lists files and folders to be ignored by git.

## Technical Overview
This application is built using several key technologies:
- **Streamlit** for the front-end interface.
- **Googletrans**: A Python library that provides a simple interface to Google Translate API.
- **gTTS**: The Google Text-to-Speech library used for converting text to audio files.
- **PyPDF2 & docx2txt**: Libraries for extracting text from PDF and Word documents.

#### Core Functions
- `translate_to_french(word)`: Handles translation from English to French using Google Translate.
- **Document Handling**: PDF and DOCX files are read and processed to extract translatable content, leveraging PyPDF2 and docx2txt.

## Known Limitations
- **Translation Accuracy**: Googletrans may not provide 100% accurate translations.
- **PDF Scans**: The app does not support OCR for scanned PDFs. Text extraction may fail if the document is a scanned image.
- **Audio Quality**: The quality of the gTTS audio might vary based on network speed.

## Future Enhancements
- **Multi-Language Support**: Expand translations to support more languages besides French.
- **OCR for PDF Scans**: Use OCR technology to enable text extraction from scanned documents.
- **User Authentication**: Add user accounts to save translations and access history.
- **Customizable Voice**: Allow users to select different voices for text-to-speech.
